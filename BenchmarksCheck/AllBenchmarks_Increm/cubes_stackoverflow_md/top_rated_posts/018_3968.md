```sql
SELECT this.*
FROM i018 AS this
JOIN ( SELECT x1.id, COUNT(x2.id) AS rnk
        FROM i018 AS x1
        LEFT JOIN i018 x2 ON x1.section_id = x2.section_id AND x2.name <= x1.name
        GROUP BY x1.id
        ) rnk
ON rnk.id = this.id
WHERE rnk.rnk <=2
ORDER BY this.section_id, rnk.rnk

```
