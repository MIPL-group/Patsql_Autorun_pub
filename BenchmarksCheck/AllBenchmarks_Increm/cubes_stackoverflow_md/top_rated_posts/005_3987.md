```sql
SELECT x.min_id, y.*
FROM (SELECT p.customer, p.total, MIN(p.id) AS min_id
      FROM i005 AS p
      GROUP BY p.customer, p.total) x
         JOIN (SELECT p.customer, MAX(total) AS max_total
               FROM i005 AS p
               GROUP BY p.customer) y
              ON y.customer = x.customer AND y.max_total = x.total
