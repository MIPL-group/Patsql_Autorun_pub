# solution

```sql
SELECT basetable.c1    as test_letter,
       basetable.c2,
       basetable.c3,
       overlaptable.c1 as overlap_letter,
       overlaptable.c2 as overlap_d1,
       overlaptable.c3 as overlap_d2
FROM "048" AS basetable
         JOIN
     "048" AS overlaptable
     ON basetable.c2 <= overlaptable.c3 AND
        basetable.c3 >= overlaptable.c2
WHERE basetable.c1 < overlaptable.c1 -- This is the change
ORDER BY basetable.c1, basetable.c2;
```
